    "To summary this article based on my point of view, I would like to start by the following. You should first check your Python, pip, setuptools wheel version. After, everything looks good, go and create your vertual environment by using this command py-m venv tutorial_env in windows. There are many ways to accomplish this task. You can use venv, as we described perivousley, also you can activate the environment using <DIR>\\Scripts\\activate. You can use pip to instal and upgrade your project. If there are any requirements files, you should install them using the follwoing py -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n",

    "To create a package, first stracture your folders that contains your modules. An example of that structure could be for example, to create a folder called src that will contain another folder called your_package_name, the last one will keep your files/modules or you feel free to create subfolders. Updating pip, build, and get ready to create your package. \n",
